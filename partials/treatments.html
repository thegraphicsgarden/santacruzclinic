		<h1>Treatments</h1>
		<p>Chinese medicine is an ancient form of preventative healthcare that functions to treat the root causes of diseases not just symptoms of underlying issues thus inhibiting the production of future ailments. This ancient form of medicine incorporates dietetics, cupping, moxa, tuina, acupuncture,  and herbal medicine to help your body heal on its own naturally and safely. Here at the Jasmine clinic I pride myself on providing comprehensive treatment plans that are specifically tailored to the needs of each individual. With the aid of Chinese medicine, aroma therapy, and meditation I am confident that as a team we can help you reach your highest potential. </p>

		<h3>Dietetics</h3>
		<p>At the Jasmine clinic we create an individual dietary plan that is necessary to give your body the nutrients and energy it needs to heal. Food is medicine, literally. Chinese medicine utilizes food differently than most western nutritionists.  Your diagnosis and treatment plan directly affects the food that is prescribed. Each patient is different thus what is beneficial for one patient could possibly be harmful for another. Even flavors and energetic temperature of foods influence your health. In addition each season has a corresponding element and organs that need to be fortified during this time by specific foods and cooking methods. In fact, if you are in tuned with nature most of the food recommendations are quite intuitive.</p>

		<h3>Cupping</h3>
		<p>Cupping is a healing modality that uses small glass cups as suctions devices that glide across the skin or stay stationary. The result is the equivalence of an inverted massage. Instead of applying pressure to a specific area cupping gently lifts muscles upward. The negative pressure created by the cups helps draw blood and energy to the target area, which helps loosen muscles and sedate the nervous system.  This gently and relaxing treatment is beneficial for releasing toxins, common cold, asthma, stiff muscles, migraines, fatigue, cellulite, and much more!</p>

		<h3>Moxa</h3>
		<p>Moxibustion  is a Chinese medicine therapy that uses the burning of mugwort to facilitate the healing process. There are different methods of burning mugwort, directly on the skin with salt, garlic, or ginger or indirectly manually or on a need.  The smell is similar to the burning of an incense and the sensation is similar to a warm hug. Studies show that moxa  over specific areas can help active immune functions and increase red and white blood cell count, enhance lymphocyte and other natural killer cell activity and Lower blood pressure. Moxa also helps autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, digestive issues, fertility and gynecological issues, injuries, arthritis, carpal tunnel, nerve inflammation, KD and GB stones,  and more!</p>

		<p>Breached baby study! In 1998  as study published in the , Journal of the American Medical Association, on the effects of moxibustion on the presentation of breech babies showed that 75% of pregnant women in the study with breeched fetuses turned into normal position.</p>

		<h3>Acupuncture</h3>
		<p>Acupuncture originated in China around 2000-60000 BC. Some believe it was first developed during the Stone Age in china. The essence of acupuncture is the belief a type of life force, energy, or “breath” called QI that flows throughout the body in energy pathways called meridians. Each meridian corresponds to a specific organ, or a group of organs, that govern certain bodily functions. Qi disharmonies cause disease and illness.  Achieving harmonious flow of qi is thought to help create and maintain health and wellness. The insertion of very thin needles in specific acupuncture points restores the balance of qi and facilitates well being. The A partial list of illness that acupuncture benefits  recognized by the World Health Organization include: alcoholism, asthma bronchitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, constipation, diarrhea, facial tics, fibromyalgia, headaches, irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovarian syndrome, low back pain, menopausal symptoms, menstrual cramps, osteoarthritis, sinusitis, irritable bowl syndrome, stroke rehabilitation, tendinitis, tennis elbow, incontinence.

		<h3>Herbal Medicine</h3>
		<p>Herbal medicine is essential in the healing processes. Hundreds of medicinal substances are used, primarily plant and some mineral products and are classified by their perceived action in the body.  Different parts of plants such as leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and seeds are used to help your body heal itself. At the Jasmine clinic I create a customized formula of Chinese herbs to fit your individual needs and also prescribe herbal tea pills, tinctures, powders, supplements, topical ointments, herbal liniments, and other forms of herbal goodness.</p>

		<h3>Aroma Therapy</h3>
		<p>I only use the purest of natural essential oils with the intention to help enhance psychological and physical well-being. Aroma therapy helps stimulate brain function, relieve pain, and help create a peaceful state of mind.  The olfactory bulb has intimate access to the amygdala, which processes emotions, and the hippocampus, which is responsible for learning. Being so closely related to memory and feelings, it is no wonder that smell can have such a strong affect on our emotional state. Essential oils carry the physical properties of flowers and plants in highly concentrated form and can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin. Most have antibacterial qualities and have varying physical and emotional effects depending  on the oil.</p>

Through a regular mediation practice one can build a strong foundation of health and growth.</p>
