	<p>I’ve learned first hand how chronic discomfort can impact ones life. Seven years ago I was in a car accident that left my knee seriously incapacitated. I struggled with pain and tears for years. Many doctors told me there was nothing they could do for me except offer pain medication and a prescription for IB profen.  From ignorant antibiotic use and previous prescription medications (in my younger years before I knew better) I learned first hand the damages some pills can have on your body and opted for a suffer alternative- acupuncture.  Acupuncture not only helped with the physical pain but it also lifted my spirits to the point where I could develop the mental strength to preserve.  Naturally there are lows in life, these humbling experiences have taught me how important it is to have a cheerleader in your corner. One who not only helps you to the best of their ability but who also encourages you to be your own personal warrior.  I know how important it is to have someone offer his or her assistance and truly care.  I would love nothing more than for you to live a happier and healthier life, and so I extend my services to you. No matter how big or small your perceived condition or issue is I would like to help.
